# Homework assignment #1 "Code Refactor"

The objective for this assignment was to refactor the code for a client. By following the semantic structures of HTML and consolidating CSS selectors and properties, also adhearing by the accessiblity standards for the handicapped.

## Semantic Code
The original engeineer who wrote the code used <div> tags. <div> tags are not semantically correct. I started by changing all of the <div> tags into <section> tags. Also making sure the spacing between tags is formatted in a way that is easier to understand for developers.

## Consolidating the CSS selectors and properties
The orginal CSS file linked to this code was very congested. Many lines in the code shared similar properties. After noticing that, I condensned down the code and grouped the similar properties under the same lines of code to not make the file seemed so cluttered.

## Accessibility Standards
